PL/SQL
	- procedural language SQL
	- an extension of SQL that adds programmatic functionality
	- postgres' version is PL/pgSQL
	- compiled by the database server to allow for more efficient calls
	  (rather than having to connect and run statements separately from your
	  back-end server, you can run them at once in your database server)
	- triggers:
		- sets of statements that can execute before or after DML
		- called automatically when specified action takes place
		- typical example is handling incrementing by pulling a value
		  from a sequence to be the ID when inserting something
	- functions
		- reusable blocks that can be called
		- can only use DQL, have a return value
		- should only use "in" parameters so that they can be called
		  directly within queries
		- can keep complicated queries more organized
	- procedures (stored procedures)
		- reusable blocks that can be called
		- can use DML, DQL, TCL
		- can use in, out, and inout parameters
		- have NO return value
		- example: adopt_cat procedure
