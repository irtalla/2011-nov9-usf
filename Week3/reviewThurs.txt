jasmine
	- a BDD (behavior-driven development) unit testing framework for JavaScript
	- made by Pivotal Labs, open source
	- works with plain JS, Node.js, Angular/TypeScript, Python, Ruby
	- main keywords/setup
		- describe('Name/description of test suite', () => {
			it('should do something', () => {
				expect(actualValue).toBe(expectedValue);
				expect(actualValue.toBeTruthy();
				expect(actualValue.toBeFalsy();
				expect(actualValue).toEqual(expectedValue);
				expect(actualValue).not.toBe(notExpectedValue);
			}
		});
		- within your test suite (describe function), you can also have
			- beforeEach, beforeAll, afterEach, afterAll
			- like so:
			beforeEach(() => { //something to happen before each spec });
	- jasmine files are spec.ts or spec.js
		- all syntax rules of ts/js apply in jasmine tests (i.e. variable scopes, etc.)
	- if you want to only run specific tests:
		- putting "fdescribe" rather than "describe" will run that test suite and only others that also have the f
		- putting "fit" rather than "it" will run that test and only others that have the f
		- the "f" stands for "focus"
		- using "x" does the opposite: runs all tests except those with x
			- xdescribe or xit
			- these specs will be marked as "pending" in the test results
protractor
	E2E (end-to-end) testing framework built for Angular applications
		- can be used for other JS or TS, but it was designed
		  for Angular & works best there
	uses Selenium as its web driver
		Selenium automates a web browser
		same locators as Selenium (slightly different syntax)
			- e.g. by css, by id, by xpath, etc.
		https://www.protractortest.org/#/locators
		- Selenium doesn't need a server for Java,
		  but Protractor does host a local server for Selenium
	uses Karma as its engine
		Karma manages tests, generates results, executes drivers
		karma.conf.js - configuration file
	protractor.conf.js - configuration file
		- allows you to specify browser, location of spec files, etc.
	the tests themselves just use Jasmine
		- describe, beforeEach, it, expect, etc.
