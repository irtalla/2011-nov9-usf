The API needs to support story pitch management system services. The story pitch 
management system streamlines the process for story story pitch submission, review,
and approval

 Authors should be able to: 
	 submit stories
	 see submitted stories 
	 remove a submitted story (pre-approval)
	 see all their stories
	 see stories organized by pipeline stage 
	 see requests from editors
	 hand requests for information
	 approve edits by senior editor
	 reject edits by sensior editor 
	 submit draft 
	 
Assistant Editors should be able to: 
	 see submitted stories for their genre 
	 reject a submitted story ( and give a reason for rejection )
	 approve a submitted story
	 request more information from author 

General Editors should be able to: 
	do everything assistant editors can do
	request more information from approving assistant editor
 
	
	* The general editor role appears to be temporary, composition
	  works best here. The general editor assigned to an approved pitch
	  can be selected at random 

Senior Editors should be able to: 
	 do everything general editors can do
	 request more information from approving general editor
	 edit tentative title, tag line, and completion date of pitch
